# Bookshelves

## Pitch
Humans need a place to organize book clubs, we decided to start creating that place. Not just another social media hub, but one tailored for book lovers.

## Concept
The concept started as a simple place to store lists of books that you have read, rate them, and add comments.
Its future dev plans evolved into a place where you can connect with others who are interested in the same genres and titles, to read throught them together and discuss them. A book club.

## Process
We started out dividing up all the roles among the 5 members of our team, but quickly the lines became blurry and everyone was working on everything, and there was a lot of colaboration.
